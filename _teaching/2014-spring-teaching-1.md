This research project focused on evaluating and improving batch effect correction methods for single-cell RNA data.

### Responsibilities
- Develop and test statistical indicators to evaluate the effectiveness of different batch effect correction methods.
- Perform batch effect correction on real datasets using ComBat-based methods and validate their effectiveness.
- Collaborate closely with the research team at Boston University, responsible for overall execution and interpretation of data analysis.
- Produce analysis results that support the effectiveness of batch effect correction methods, contributing to the accuracy of single-cell RNA-sequencing data analysis.
