Recently, I completed the construction of a **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** model applied to *systematic literature review (SLR)* tasks. This model integrates citation relationships and semantic similarity between publications to identify research topics and emerging trends.

Next, I will work on building a **GNN model for traffic applications under extreme weather conditions**. This project will:
- Construct a spatial-temporal graph representing road networks, traffic flow, and weather conditions.
- Integrate real-time traffic data with extreme weather information such as heavy rainfall, snowstorms, and high winds.
- Investigate how extreme weather disrupts traffic patterns, increases congestion risks, and impacts network resilience.

## Recent Work: Literature Review GNN
The SLR-focused GNN has demonstrated strong potential for:
- Automating thematic clustering in large academic corpora.
- Providing interpretable outputs to support research synthesis.
- Highlighting emerging research areas and interdisciplinary connections.

## Upcoming Work: Extreme Weather Traffic GNN
The next phase will adapt GNN techniques to model complex, dynamic traffic systems affected by severe weather.  
Expected outcomes include:
- Improved travel time prediction under adverse conditions.
- Insights for urban planners and emergency response teams.

## Stay Tuned
The transition from literature analysis to traffic resilience modeling will help explore the adaptability of GNN approaches across domains.
