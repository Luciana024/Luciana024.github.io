Welcome! I’m **Fengjiao Li**, a **PhD student in Geospatial Data Science** at the **University of Glasgow**, with a strong academic background in **Statistics**.

My research lies at the intersection of **Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI)**, **spatial statistics**, and **machine learning**, with a particular focus on developing advanced **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** models for analyzing **spatial and dynamic population processes**. Drawing on my **statistical training**, I aim to create **interpretable**, **robust**, and **scalable** methods for understanding how **populations move** and how **diseases spread** over space and time.

My current doctoral project focuses on embedding **spatial structures**, **population mobility**, and **temporal dynamics** into neural network architectures to support **health risk analysis** in **urban environments**. I work on integrating **statistical reasoning** with **AI-driven models** to improve **epidemic modeling**, **risk prediction**, and **intervention planning**.

By combining insights from **statistics**, **epidemiology**, and **geographical data science**, I strive to develop **data-driven tools** that are not only **technically rigorous** but also **practically useful** for **public health decision-making**.
