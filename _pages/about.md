Welcome! I’m **Fengjiao Li**, a PhD student in *Geospatial Data Science* at the University of Glasgow.

My research focuses on **Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI)** and the development of **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** tailored for **spatial and dynamic population modeling**, especially in the context of **health risk analysis**. My doctoral work aims to embed spatial intelligence into neural network architectures to better understand population movement and disease distribution over time.
